# Student Support Program 
# Introduction 
The Student Support Program is a C++-based application designed to assist students in finding 
suitable universities and scholarships based on their academic profiles. By leveraging data 
structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees (BST), the program 
provides an efficient and user-friendly portal for students to explore educational opportunities 
and manage scholarship applications.  
# Objectives

location, and program of study.

amount. 
- Application Management: Allow students to apply for scholarships and track their 
applications. 
- Recommendation System: Provide personalized university recommendations based on 
the student's major. 
- History Tracking: Maintain a history of recommendations for quick reference. 
- Efficient Data Management: Utilize appropriate data structures to ensure fast and 
reliable operations.
