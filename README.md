# Student Support Program 
# Introduction 
The Student Support Program is a C++-based application designed to assist students in finding 
suitable universities and scholarships based on their academic profiles. By leveraging data 
structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees (BST), the program 
provides an efficient and user-friendly portal for students to explore educational opportunities 
and manage scholarship applications.  
# Objectives 
-  University Search: Enable students to find universities matching their GPA, preferred 
location, and program of study. 
- Scholarship Finder: Identify scholarships based on GPA and major, sorted by award 
amount. 
- Application Management: Allow students to apply for scholarships and track their 
applications. 
- Recommendation System: Provide personalized university recommendations based on 
the student's major. 
- History Tracking: Maintain a history of recommendations for quick reference. 
- Efficient Data Management: Utilize appropriate data structures to ensure fast and 
reliable operations.
# Implementation Details 
- Main Function: Orchestrates the program flow, including menu display and user input 
handling. 
- Data Loading: The loadSampleData function populates the BST with university data 
and an array with scholarship data. 
- Search Functions: 
- findUniversities: Traverses the BST to find universities matching GPA, 
location, and program. 
- findScholarships: Scans the scholarship array and sorts results by award 
amount. 
- Recommendation System: The getRecommendations function matches universities by 
major and stores them in a stack. 
- Application Management: The enqueue function in the Queue class adds scholarship 
applications, and display shows the application list. 
- History Tracking: The push and displayRecent functions in the Stack class manage 
recommendation history.
# Error Handling 
- Checks for empty data structures (e.g., empty stack/queue). 
- Validates user input for GPA and scholarship amounts. 
- Displays appropriate messages when no matches are found.
# Data Structures Used 
The program employs multiple data structures to achieve its functionality efficiently: 
1. Arrays: 
-  Purpose: Store scholarships and temporary results for universities and 
scholarships. 
-  Implementation: Fixed-size arrays (MAX_SCHOLARSHIPS, MAX_UNIVERSITIES) 
for simplicity. 
-  Usage: Scholarships are stored in an array for quick access during searches. 
Results arrays hold filtered universities/scholarships for display. 
-  Complexity: O(n) for searching, O(nÂ²) for sorting scholarships by award. 
2. Linked Lists: 
-  Purpose: Form the basis for Stack and Queue implementations. 
-  Implementation: Doubly linked lists for Stack (recommendation history) and 
Queue (scholarship applications). 
-  Usage: Enable dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion. 
-  Complexity: O(1) for push/pop (Stack) and enqueue (Queue), O(n) for display. 
3. Stack: 
-  Purpose: Store recommendation history for quick access to the most recent 
recommendation. 
-  Implementation: Doubly linked list-based stack with push, pop, and 
displayRecent operations. 
-  Usage: Pushes universities recommended to the user, allowing retrieval of the 
latest recommendation. 
-  Complexity: O(1) for push/pop, O(1) for displaying the most recent item. 
4. Queue: 
-  Purpose: Manage scholarship applications in the order they are submitted. 
-  Implementation: Doubly linked list-based queue with enqueue and display 
operations. 
-  Usage: Enqueues scholarship applications and displays them in order. 
-  Complexity: O(1) for enqueue, O(n) for display. 
5. Binary Search Tree (BST): 
-  Purpose: Store and retrieve universities sorted by ranking. 
-  Implementation: BST with insert, inorderTraversal, and getSorted 
operations. 
-  Usage: Organizes universities by ranking for efficient retrieval during searches 
and recommendations. 
-  Complexity: O(h) for insertion (where h is tree height), O(n) for inorder traversal 
to retrieve sorted universities.
# Target Audience 
1.Primary Audience 
- High School Students: Seeking universities and scholarships for undergraduate studies. 
- Undergraduate Students: Exploring transfer options or scholarships for advanced 
studies. 
- International Students: Looking for universities in specific locations (e.g., USA, 
Pakistan) with programs matching their interests. 
2.Secondary Audience 
- Academic Advisors: Assisting students in finding suitable educational opportunities. 
- Parents/Guardians: Supporting their children in navigating university and scholarship 
options. 
- Educational Institutions: Using the program as a tool to guide students toward partner 
universities or scholarships.
# Conclusion 
The Student Support Program is a robust and functional application that demonstrates the 
effective use of data structures to solve a real-world problem. By providing students with tools to 
find universities, scholarships, and manage applications, it serves as a valuable educational 
resource. The project's modular design and clear documentation make it suitable for academic 
evaluation and future expansion. With potential enhancements like database integration and a 
GUI, the program could evolve into a widely-used tool for students worldwide.
